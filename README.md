# Iris ML Classifier 🌸

A machine learning project that classifies the famous Iris dataset using a *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* model.  
This project demonstrates preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocesses data using StandardScaler
- Trains an SVM classifier with RBF kernel
- Evaluates performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualizes the confusion matrix using seaborn

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 File

- iris_svm_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all code, training steps, and outputs.

---

## ⚙ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rayanshihab/iris-ml-classifier.git
   
   cd iris-ml-classifier
jupyter notebook
3.	Run all cells to see preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
